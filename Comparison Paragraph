After reading this article, I agree with what the writer has to say about RARRA vs AARRR. I can completely understand why AARRR would make sense when laying out the steps to make something successful. Logically, you would think that before we can do anything, we’d need to obtain acquisitions, because how else would we reach the rest of the tears. However, after breaking it down, the author really makes a fair point, it doesn’t matter how many people you can get to use something in the first three days, you want to displaying something people want to continue to use after, 30, 60, and 90 days. Otherwise, there is no way to sustain and maintain something with no dedicated following. 
Some of the strongest evidence in favor of the RARRA framework was actually presented in the beginning of the article when he presented the chats of app usage on android vs ios. I think this gave a very intense and unexpected visual representation of how quickly users stop using apps in this over populated market. He then was able to relate all of this information in how you can reform your site, even after the launch. Which is also very useful information.
I would definitely move forward using the RARRA framework to launch my website or business.
